 <h3>Welcome To My Blog</h3>

 <p> My name is Badr Boussoufa and I am 40 years old.I love sports for everything they have taught me about teamwork, leadership, community, hard work, the pursuit of excellence and achieving goals. All of these positive skills helped me become a better person.</p>


<h3>Sport improves your mood</h3>
