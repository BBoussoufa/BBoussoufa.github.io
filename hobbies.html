<h3 id="soccer">Why Do I love Soccer</h3>
<p class="sport">I like soccer because it is a game that is more player-focused than other. A game in where you can depend more on individual plays from a single player than other team sports. It gives the opportunity for the players to shine, which feels very pleasant for anyone.</p>

<h3 id="soccer">Why Do I love Tennis</h3>
<p class="sport">I like tennis because Tennis is good for the mind too. Tennis constantly presents you with opportunities to focus, to overcome obstacles and to rise to the occasion with grace and perseverance.</p>

<h3>Why Do I love History</h3>
<p class="hobby">I like history since it  has very important across cultures.
History Builds Empathy Through Studying the Lives and Struggles of Others. Studying the diversity of human experience helps us appreciate cultures, ideas, and traditions that are not our own â€“ and to recognize them as meaningful products of specific times and places.</p>

<h3>Why Do I love Volunteering</h3>
<p class="hobby">Volunteering provides physical and mental rewards. It reduces stress. Experts report that when you focus on someone other than yourself, it interrupts usual tension-producing patterns. Makes you healthier: Moods and emotions, like optimism, joy, and control over one's fate, strengthen the immune system.</p>
